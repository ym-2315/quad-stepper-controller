# Quad Stepper Controller (THT only)
This is my **first PCB design attempt** using KiCad.  
It’s a **quad stepper motor controller** built with only **through-hole components (THT)** that I had available.  

##  Features
- Controls up to 4 stepper motors
- Built using common THT components
- Simple design, good for learning PCB layout and stepper interfacing

##  Repository
- `kicad/` → KiCad source files (`.kicad_sch`, `.kicad_pcb`, etc.)
- `outputs/` → Generated files (Gerbers, BOM, PDFs)
- `images/` → Screenshots and 3D renders

##  Notes
- This is my first attempt at PCB design.
- Not tested or manufactured yet.
- Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
